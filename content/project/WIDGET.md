The WIDGeT consortium (Viral Vector Intelligent Design for Gene Therapy) aims to accelerate the development of gene therapies using viral vectors derived from adeno-associated viruses (AAV) for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and hereditary podocytopathies (kidney diseases), leveraging the potential of artificial intelligence (AI).
